# Whole Application Acceleration: Accelerating ML Preprocessing for Classification and Detection networks

## Introduction

This application demonstrates how XilinxÂ® [Vitis Vision library](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/tree/master/vision) functions can be integrated with deep neural network (DNN) accelerator to achieve complete application acceleration. This application focuses on accelerating the pre-processing involved in inference of object detection networks.

## Background

Input images are preprocessed  before being fed for inference of different deep neural networks. The pre-processing steps vary from network to network. For example, for classification networks like Resnet-50 the input image is resized to 224 x 224 size and then channel-wise mean subtraction is performed before feeding the data to the DNN accelerator. For detection networks like YOLO v3 the input image is resized to 256 x 512 size using letterbox before feeding the data to the DNN accelerator. 


[Vitis Vision library](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/tree/master/vision) provides functions optimized for FPGA devices that are drop-in replacements for standard OpenCV library functions. This application demonstrates how Vitis Vision library functions can be used to accelerate pre-processing.

## Resnet50

Currently, applications accelerating pre-processing for classification networks (Resnet-50) is provided and  can only run on ZCU102 board (device part  xczu9eg-ffvb1156-2-e). In this application, software JPEG decoder is used for loading input image. Three processes are created one for image loading , one for running pre-processing kernel and one for running the ML accelerator. JPEG decoder transfer input image data to pre-processing kernel over queue and the pre-processed data is transferred to the ML accelerator over a queue. Below image shows the inference pipeline.

## ADAS detection

ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) application
using YOLO-v3 network model is an example for object detection.
Accelerating pre-processing for YOLO-v3 is provided and can only run on ZCU102 board (device part xczu9eg-ffvb1156-2-e). In this application, software JPEG decoder is used for loading input image. Three processes are created one for image loading , one for running pre-processing kernel and one for running the ML accelerator. JPEG decoder transfer input image data to pre-processing kernel over queue and the pre-processed data is transferred to the ML accelerator over a queue. Below image shows the inference pipeline.

## Running the Application
### Setting Up the Target
**To improve the user experience, the Vitis AI Runtime packages have been built into the board image. Therefore, user does not need to install Vitis AI
Runtime packages on the board separately.**

1. Installing a Board Image.
	* Download the SD card system image files from the following links:  
	
		[ZCU102](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=xilinx-zcu102-dpu-v2020.1-v1.2.0.img.gz)  
	
      	Note: The version of the board image should be 2020.1 or above.
	* Use Etcher software to burn the image file onto the SD card.
	* Insert the SD card with the image into the destination board.
	* Plug in the power and boot the board using the serial port to operate on the system.
	* Set up the IP information of the board using the serial port.
	You can now operate on the board using SSH.
	
2. Update the system image files.
	* Download the [waa_system_v1.2.0.tar.gz](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=waa_system_v1.2.0.tar.gz).	
	* Copy the `waa_system_v1.2.0.tar.gz` to the board using scp.
	```
	scp waa_system_v1.2.0.tar.gz root@IP_OF_BOARD:~/
	```
	* Update the system image files on the target side
	```
	cd ~
	tar -xzvf waa_system_v1.2.0.tar.gz
	cp waa_system_v1.2.0/sd_card/* /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1/
	cp /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1/dpu.xclbin /usr/lib/
	ln -s /usr/lib/dpu.xclbin /mnt/dpu.xclbin
	cp waa_system_v1.2.0/lib/* /usr/lib/
	reboot
	```
	**Note that `waa_system_v1.2.0.tar.gz` can only be used for ZCU102.**
	
### Running The Examples
Before running the examples on the target, please copy the examples and images to the target.

1. Copy the examples to the board using scp.
```
scp -r Vitis-AI/VART/Whole-App-Acceleration root@IP_OF_BOARD:~/
```
2. Prepare the images for the test

For resnet50_mt_py_waa example, download the images at http://image-net.org/download-images and copy 1000 images to `Vitis-AI/VART/Whole-App-Acceleration/resnet50_mt_py_waa/images` 

For adas_detection_waa example, download the images at https://cocodataset.org/#download and copy the images to `Vitis-AI/VART/Whole-App-Acceleration/adas_detection_waa/data`

3. Compile and run the program on the target

For resnet50_mt_py_waa example, please refer to [resnet50_mt_py_waa readme](./resnet50_mt_py_waa/readme) 

For adas_detection_waa example, please refer to [adas_detection_waa readme](./adas_detection_waa/readme) 

### Performance:
Below table shows the comparison of througput achieved by acclerating the pre-processing pipeline on FPGA. 
For `Resnet-50`, the performance numbers are achieved by running 1K images randomly picked from ImageNet dataset.
For `YOLO v3`, the performance numbers are achieved by running 5K images randomly picked from COCO dataset.
