    "This notebook uses notebook 2 as starting point and adds a 2D convolution filter accelerator into the video pipeline. Three versions of the 2D filter accelerator are available:\n",
    "* Implemented in software running on the A72 cores (PS) using standard OpenCV functions\n",
    "* Implemented in the PL using the Vitis Vision libraries and high-level synthesis (HLS)\n",
    "* Implemented in the AI Engine (AIE) using one AIE core with HLS-based data mover in the PL\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D filter has a fixed kernel size of 3x3. It operates on the luma channel of a YUY2 image; the chroma channel is looped back unmodified.For the AIE version of the 2D filter, the chroma loopback is performed inside the data mover and only the chroma channel is forwarded to the AIE core that performs the convolution.\n",
    "The PL 2D filter performs the chroma loopback inside the kernel itself. In addition, the PL version has run-time programmable kernel coefficients and presets as well as well image dimensions. For the AIE version, the kernel coefficients are hard-coded to \"horizontal sobel\" and the image dimensions are fixed at 1280x720. This limitation will be fixed in a future release.\n",

    "For more information on the 2D convolution filter operation, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing).\n",

    "The various 2D filter accelerators are integrated into Gstreamer using the Vitis Video Analytics SDK (VVAS) which provides a set of plugins and an abstraction layer on top of the Xilinx run-time (XRT). For more information, see here: https://xilinx.github.io/VVAS/.\n",

    "The video pipeline is composed of the following GStreamer elements:\n",
    "* The ``mediasrcbin`` element is used to capture video from a V4L2 device\n",
    "* The ``ivas_xfilter`` element is used to wrap the 2D convolution filter accelerator library\n",
    "* The ``jpegenc`` element is used to compress the raw video format to JPEG.\n",
    "* The ``appsink`` element is used to make the JPEG frames available to the jupyter notebook where they are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Create a GStreamer video pipeline that captures video from a V4L2 device, performs the 2D convolution, and displays the processed video inside this notebook.\n",
    "2. Switch between the different 2D filter implementations: PS, PL, or AIE\n",
    "3. Modify the filter presets or coefficients for the PS/PL implementations\n",
    "4. Create a GStreamer pipeline graph and view it inside this notebook.\n",
