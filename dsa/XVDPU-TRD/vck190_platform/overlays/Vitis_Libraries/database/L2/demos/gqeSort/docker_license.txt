4.	Ownership.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all intellectual property and industrial rights 
in and to the Licensed Materials and all copies thereof are and will remain the sole property of Xilinx, or its 
licensors (if any).  Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as conferring by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise upon Licensee any license or other right except the licenses and rights expressly 
granted to Licensee in Section 2 (License Grants).  Licensee understands that portions of the Licensed 
Materials and related documentation may have been licensed to Xilinx from third parties and that such third 
parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of this Agreement.  The Licensed Materials 
are protected by laws and international treaty provisions covering intellectual property and industrial rights.  
All modifications, changes, improvements and enhancements to the Licensed Materials (collectively 
“Modifications”) shall be the sole property of Xilinx.  Licensee hereby assigns and agrees to assign to 
Xilinx Licensee's entire right, title and interest in and to the Modifications and all associated intellectual 
property rights, and Licensee shall acquire no greater rights therein than specifically provided for in this 
Agreement; provided however that Licensee shall have no obligation to disclose or provide such 
Modifications to Xilinx and “Modifications” do not include technology independently developed by 
Licensee that is added to or incorporated in the Licensed Materials.  Licensee agrees that any Modifications 
are made solely at its own risk and that Xilinx accepts no liability whatsoever for any such Modifications.
4.1	Third-Party / Open Source Licenses.  Certain files, programs or other materials distributed in 
connection with the Licensed Materials may originate from Xilinx or third-party licensors and are licensed 
to Licensee (not under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, but rather) pursuant to the terms and 
conditions of the applicable licenses that appear in Exhibit A attached hereto or upon installation, 
acceptance and/or activation of the Licensed Materials and/or are contained or described in the 
corresponding release notes or other documentation or header or source files.  Such files, programs or other 
materials may be subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License or other open source or free 
software licenses.  Licensee agrees to carefully review and abide by the terms and conditions of these 
licenses to the extent that they govern such files, programs or other materials.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, as between Xilinx and Licensee, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and if not 
prohibited by any such third-party licenses, all such third-party files, programs or other materials shall be 
deemed covered under Sections 6 (Disclaimers) and 7 (Limitation of Liability) and 9.3 (Governing Law) of 
this Agreement.
4.2	Xilinx Acceleration Application Store.  As described more particularly in the user guide for the 
Licensed Materials, Licensee must obtain a license key from Xilinx in order for the Licensed Materials to 
execute all of the functions described in the user guide.  In order to obtain a license key, access the Xilinx 
Acceleration Application Store on www.Xilinx.com and follow the instructions set forth in the user guide.  
The license key is stored within a “cred.json” file downloaded from www.Xilinx.com.  This “cred.json” file 
shall be deemed to be part of the Licensed Materials and Licensee agrees that the “cred.json” file shall be 
used strictly in accordance with this Agreement and not distributed to any third party without Xilinx’s 
written authorization.
5.	Confidentiality.  
       5.1	Duties.  Except as otherwise expressly permitted in Section 2 (License Grants), Licensee 
shall (a) maintain the confidentiality of the Licensed Materials; and (b) not make the Licensed Materials 
available in any form to any person other than to its employees and contractors who have a genuine “need 
to know” on behalf of Licensee for purposes authorized by this Agreement, and who are bound by 
obligations of confidentiality no less protective of Xilinx (and its licensors, if any) than those contained 
herein.  Licensee represents to Xilinx that it maintains a system of confidentiality consistent with 
commonly accepted practices to protect its own confidential business information, including written 
agreements with employees and contractors, and that the Licensed Materials will be protected by such a 
system to the same extent, but in no event with less than reasonable care.  Licensee shall be liable to Xilinx 
for any failure of its contractors to comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement as if such failure 
was a failure of the Licensee. Licensee agrees that a breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable and 
continuing damage to Xilinx for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, and Xilinx shall be 
entitled to seek injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other relief (including 
monetary damages) as may be proper.
       5.2	Exceptions. The obligations of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not apply to 
information that: (a) is already known to Licensee at the time of disclosure without obligation of 
confidentiality; (b) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act or omission of Licensee; (c) is 
rightfully received by Licensee from a third party without obligation of confidentiality; (d) is approved for 
release by written authorization of Xilinx; or (e) was developed by Licensee independently and without the 
use or benefit of the Licensed Materials.
6.	Disclaimers.
       6.1	TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE 
LICENSED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OR 
REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND, AND XILINX DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND

FOR VERIFICATION OF ITS DESIGN.  XILINX SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATIONS 
FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND BUG FIXES, AS WELL AS ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM 
LICENSEE’S USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS.
       6.2	LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS IN 
COMBINATION WITH OTHER FUNCTIONALITY, CORES, SOFTWARE OR PROTOCOLS MAY 
REQUIRE LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES AND LICENSEE ACCEPTS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR OBTAINING SUCH LICENSES.
       6.3	THE LICENSED MATERIALS ARE NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE FAIL-
SAFE, OR FOR USE IN ANY APPLICATION REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS 
APPLICATIONS RELATED TO LIFE-SUPPORT OR SAFETY DEVICES OR SYSTEMS, CLASS III 
MEDICAL DEVICES, NUCLEAR FACILITIES, DEPLOYMENT OF AIRBAGS, CONTROL OF 
VEHICLE OR AIRCRAFT (UNLESS THERE IS A FAIL-SAFE OR REDUNDANCY FEATURE 
WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE USE OF SOFTWARE IN THE XILINX DEVICE TO IMPLEMENT 
THE REDUNDANCY AND A WARNING SIGNAL UPON FAILURE TO THE OPERATOR), OR ANY 
OTHER APPLICATIONS THAT COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY OR SEVERE 
PROPERTY OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY, 
“CRITICAL APPLICATIONS”).  LICENSEE AGREES, PRIOR TO USING OR DISTRIBUTING ANY 
SYSTEMS THAT INCORPORATE THE LICENSED MATERIALS, TO THOROUGHLY TEST THE 
SAME FOR SAFETY PURPOSES.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW, LICENSEE ASSUMES THE SOLE RISK AND LIABILITY OF ANY USE OF THE LICENSED 
MATERIALS IN CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.
7.	Limitation of Liability.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW:  (1) IN NO EVENT SHALL XILINX OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF 
DATA, LOST PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR 
SERVICES, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES 
ARISING UNDER, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE 
OR OPERATION OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, HOWEVER CAUSED 
AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY; (2) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ENTIRE LIABILITY 
OF XILINX OR ITS LICENSORS ARISING UNDER, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH 
THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF LICENSE FEES RECEIVED BY XILINX FROM 
LICENSEE FOR THE LICENSED MATERIALS; (3) THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS 
SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LOSS WAS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE 
OR IF XILINX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND (4) THESE 
LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL 
PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDIES HEREIN.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER 
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY EXCLUDES OR LIMITS ITS LIABILITY IN 
ANY WAY FOR ANY MATTER THAT CANNOT, AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, BE 
LIMITED OR EXCLUDED.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 7 (LIMITATION OF 
LIABILITY) REPRESENTS AN ALLOCATION OF RISK WHICH THE PARTIES CONSIDER 
REASONABLE.
8.	Term and Termination.

required by the applicable license; and we may charge you the cost thereof unless prohibited by the license) 
to provide you with a copy of such source code; and to accept such offer send a letter requesting such 
source code (please be specific by identifying the particular Xilinx Licensed Materials you are inquiring

Ubuntu is a collection of thousands of computer programs and documents created by a range of individuals, 
teams and companies.
Each of these programs may come under a different licence. This licence policy describes the process that 
we follow in determining which software will be included by default in the Ubuntu operating system.

Copyright licensing and trademarks are two different areas of law, and we consider them separately in 
Ubuntu. The following policy applies only to copyright licences. We evaluate trademarks on a case-by-case 
basis.

Categories of software in Ubuntu
The thousands of software packages available for Ubuntu are organised into four key groups or components: 
main, restricted, universe and multiverse. Software is published in one of these components based on 
whether or not it meets our free software philosophy, and the level of support we can provide for it. In 
addition, software may be published for Ubuntu as a universal Linux snap package, in which case licenses 
are determined by the snap publisher and documented in the snap store.

This policy only addresses the software that you will find in main and restricted, which contain software 
that is fully supported by the Ubuntu team and must comply with this policy.

Ubuntu 'main' component licence policy
All application software included in the Ubuntu main component:

Must include source code. The main component has a strict and non-negotiable requirement that 
application software included in it must come with full source code.
Must allow modification and distribution of modified copies under the same licence. Just having the source 
code does not convey the same freedom as having the right to change it. Without the ability to modify 
software, the Ubuntu community cannot support software, fix bugs, translate it, or improve it.
Ubuntu 'main' and 'restricted' component licence policy
All application software in both main and restricted must meet the following requirements:
Must allow redistribution. Your right to sell or give away the software alone, or as part of an aggregate 
software distribution, is important because:
You, the user, must be able to pass on any software you have received from Ubuntu in either source code or 
compiled form.
While Ubuntu will not charge licence fees for this distribution, you might want to charge to print Ubuntu 
CDs, or create your own customised versions of Ubuntu which you sell, and should have the freedom to do 
so.
Must not require royalty payments or any other fee for redistribution or modification.It's important that you 
can exercise your rights to this software without having to pay for the privilege, and that you can pass these 
rights on to other people on exactly the same basis.
Must allow these rights to be passed on along with the software. You should be able to have exactly the 
same rights to the software as we do.
Must not discriminate against persons, groups or against fields of endeavour. The licence of software 
included in Ubuntu can not discriminate against anyone or any group of users and cannot restrict users from 
using the software for a particular field of endeavour - a business for example. So we will not distribute 
software that is licensed "freely for non-commercial use".
Must not be distributed under a licence specific to Ubuntu. The rights attached to the software must not 
depend on the program being part of Ubuntu system. So we will not distribute software for which Ubuntu 
has a "special" exemption or right, and we will not put our own software into Ubuntu and then refuse you 
the right to pass it on.
Must not contaminate other software licences.The licence must not place restrictions on other software that 
is distributed along with it. For example, the licence must not insist that all other programmes distributed 
on the same medium be free software.
May require source modifications to be distributed as patches. In some cases, software authors are happy 
for us to distribute their software and modifications to their software, as long as the two are distributed 
separately, so that people always have a copy of their pristine code. We are happy to respect this preference. 
However, the licence must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code.
Documentation, firmware and drivers
Ubuntu contains licensed and copyrighted works that are not application software. For example, the default 
Ubuntu installation includes documentation, images, sounds, video clips and firmware. The Ubuntu 
community will make decisions on the inclusion of these works on a case-by-case basis, ensuring that these 
works do not restrict our ability to make Ubuntu available free of charge, and that you can continue to 
redistribute Ubuntu.

Software installed by default
When you install Ubuntu, you will typically install a complete desktop environment. It is also possible to 
install a minimal set of software (just enough to boot your machine) and then manually select the precise 
software applications to install. Such a "custom" install is usually favoured by server administrators, who 
prefer to keep only the software they absolutely need on the server.

All of the application software installed by default is free software. In addition, we install some hardware 
drivers that are available only in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked in the restricted 
component.

Homepage: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

This is the Debian prepackaged version of the ncurses
library and terminfo utilities. ncurses/terminfo was originally written
by Pavel Curtis and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim <zmbenhal@netcom.com>, and is
currently held by the Free Software Foundation.

This package was put together by Vaidhyanathan G Mayilrangam
<vaidhy@debian.org> and Joel Klecker <espy@debian.org>, using sources
obtained from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.0.tar.gz.
Current versions of the ncurses sources are found at
ftp://invisible-island.net/ncurses/.

It is based somewhat on work done by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com>,
David Engel <david@elo.ods.com>.  Michael Alan Dorman
<mdorman@debian.org>, Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>, James Troup
<jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>, J.H.M. Dassen (Ray)
<jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>, and Galen Hazelwood <galenh@micron.net>
over various years.

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>
Homepage: http://www.python.org/

This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Python programming
language. Python was written by Guido van Rossum <guido@cwi.nl> and others.

This package was put together by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org> from
sources from ftp.python.org:/pub/python, based on the Debianization by
the previous maintainers Bernd S. Brentrup <bsb@uni-muenster.de> and
Bruce Perens.

Current maintainer is Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org> until the final
2.3 version is released.

--------------------------------------------------------------

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
