Overview
########

The Vitis vision library has been designed to work in the Vitis development environment, and provides a software
interface for computer vision functions accelerated on an FPGA device.
Vitis vision library functions are mostly similar in functionality to their
OpenCV equivalent. Any deviations, if present, are documented.


.. seealso:: For more information on the Vitis vision library please refer :ref:`Prerequisites <prerequisites_hls>` section

To familiarize yourself with the steps required to use the Vitis vision library
functions, see the `Using the Vitis vision
Library <using-the-vitis-vision-library.html>`__.

.. _basic-features:

Basic Features
===============

All Vitis vision library functions follow a common format. The following
properties hold true for all the functions.

-  All the functions are designed as templates and all arguments that
   are images, must be provided as ``xf::cv::Mat``.
-  All functions are defined in the ``xf::cv`` namespace.
-  Some of the major template arguments are:

   -  Maximum size of the image to be processed
   -  Datatype defining the properties of each pixel
   -  Number of pixels to be processed per clock cycle
   -  Other compile-time arguments relevent to the functionality.

The Vitis vision library contains enumerated datatypes which enables you to
configure ``xf::cv::Mat``. For more details on ``xf::cv::Mat``, see the `xf::cv::Mat
Image Container Class <api-reference.html>`__.

.. _xfopencv-kernel:

Vitis Vision Kernel on Vitis
============================

The Vitis vision library is designed to be used with the Vitis development
environment. 

The OpenCL host code is written in the testbench file, whereas the calls to Vitis 
Vision functions are done from the accel file.
The image containers for Vitis vision library functions are ``xf::cv::Mat``
objects. For more information, see the `xf::cv::Mat Image Container
Class <api-reference.html>`__.
