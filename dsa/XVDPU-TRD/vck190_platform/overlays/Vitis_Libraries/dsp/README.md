# Vitis DSP Library

Vitis DSP library provides implementation of different L1/L2/L3 primitives for digital signal processing.
Current version provides:
- L1 level HLS C++ implementation of Discrete Fourier Transform using Fast Fourier Transform algorithm for acceleration on Xilinx FPGAs.
- L2 level AIE C++ graph implementation of FFT, FIRs, Matrix Multiply (GeMM) and utility Widgets.

Note: Only L1/L2 promitives are delivered currently.
