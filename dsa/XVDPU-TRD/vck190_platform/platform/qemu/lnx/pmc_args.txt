# This is file which used to generate QEMU(which emulates PMC/Microblaze)
# commandline(start_pmc.sh script) which used in Versal-PMC HW-EMU. 
# This is a template file which is packaged in platform and it gets 
# processed by Vitis tool to generate meaningful file.
#
# This file contains flag and value pairs and they must be seperated 
# into two lines value followed by flag. Below are the common/mandated 
# flag and value pairs used for emulating Versal-PMC. User can add more 
# commandline args to this file depends on requirements.
# 
# For more details on the QEMU commandline, please refer to 
# the QEMU user guide UG1169.

# If your platform has different memory, then you need to create
