<br />
Vitis AI is composed of the following key components:

* **AI Model Zoo**  - A comprehensive set of pre-optimized models that are ready to deploy on Xilinx devices.
* **AI Optimizer** - An optional model optimizer that can prune a model by up to 90%. It is seperately available with commercial licenses.
* **AI Quantizer** - A powerful quantizer that supports model quantization, calibration, and fine tuning.
* **AI Compiler** - Compiles the quantized model to a high-efficient instruction set and data flow. 
* **AI Profiler** - Perform an in-depth analysis of the efficiency and utilization of AI inference implementation.
* **AI Library** - Offers high-level yet optimized C++ APIs for AI applications from edge to cloud.
* **DPU** - Efficient and scalable IP cores can be customized to meet the needs for many different applications

## Getting Started

To facilitate the setup of Vitis AI environment, the docker container is used for Vitis AI package distribution. 
Vitis AI consists of three docker container images: two vitis-ai-docker-tools images and one vitis-ai-docker-runtime image. 
The two vitis-ai-docker-tools images are for GPU and CPU environments respectively. 
The vitis-ai-docker-tools contains the Vitis AI quantizer, AI compiler and examples. 
The vitis-ai-docker-runtime is the runtime docker image for DPU-v2 development, which holds Vitis AI installation package 
for Xilinx ZCU102 and ZCU104 evaluation boards, samples, and Arm GCC cross-compilation toolchain.

 - Clone the Vitis-AI repository to obtain the examples, reference code, and scripts. 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI  
    
    cd Vitis-AI
    ```  
 - [Install Docker](doc/install_docker/README.md) - if Docker not installed on your machine yet
 
 - [Ensure your linux user is in the group docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
 
 - [Load&Run Docker Container](doc/install_docker/load_run_docker.md)  
 
 - Get started with examples
    - [ZU+ MPSoC/Zynq-7000](mpsoc/README.md)
    - [Alveo](alveo/README.md)

## Programming with Vitis AI

Vitis AI offers a unified set of high-level C++/Python programming APIs to run AI applications across edge-to-cloud platforms, including DPUv1 and DPUv3 for Alveo,  
and DPUv2 for Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC and Zynq-7000. It brings the benefits to easily port AI applications from cloud to edge and vice versa. 
7 samples in [Vitis AI Samples for Zynq](mpsoc/vitis_ai_samples_zcu102) and [Vitis AI Samples for Alveo](alveo/examples/vitis_ai_alveo_samples) are available 
to help you get familiar with the unfied programming APIs.
