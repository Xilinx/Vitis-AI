# Model Description

## Description

YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) is an advanced real-time object detection model that is widely used in computer 
vision applications to detect and classify objects within an image or video frame.  

## Paper

 Bochkovskiy A., Wang C. Y., Liao H. Y. M. Yolov4: Optimal speed and accuracy of object detection. <br>
 //arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.10934. – 2020. Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934

# Model Architecture
The architecture of YOLOv4 consists of a powerful backbone network (CSPDarknet53), a feature fusion mechanism, 
and three detection heads operating at different scales. It also incorporates advanced training techniques such as 
data augmentation and multi-scale training.

# Dataset

Dataset for testing: COCO. The COCO dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of object detection. 
It focuses on high-quality pixel-level annotations for various urban objects, including cars, pedestrians, roads, buildings, traffic signs, and more.

# Features

The notable features of the SemanticFPN:

1. **Efficient backbone network** - CSPDarknet53
2. **Feature fusion techniques** - FPN and PANet.
3. 3 detection heads operate at different scales to detect objects of various sizes
4. **Performance** - good balance between accuracy and real-time processing speed.

# Environment Requirements

Before running the model inference, make sure that the latest version of
[Vitis-AI](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/docs/install/install.html) is installed and the host computer fully supports
Xilinx FPGA/ACAP and the appropriate accelerator is installed correctly, e.g. Xilinx VCK5000 Versal.

# Quick Start

Follow the [Quick Start guide](../../../README.md#quick-start) in the main Model Zoo README:

1. Install the Vitis-AI
2. Run the docker container
3. Download test data
4. Run the inference of the model

## Inference Process

- Native inference - follow the [Quick Start guide](../../../README.md#quick-start) in the main Model Zoo
- AMD Server

# Quality

Use the following script:

```bash
  # Format: bash scripts/quality.sh <inference_result> <ground_truth> [--batch] [--dataset]
  # where:
  #  inference_result  - Path to the inference result image or folder.
  #  ground_truth      - Path to the ground truth image or folder
  # --batch            - Evaluate a dataset (default: individual images)
  # --dataset          - Evaluate Cityscapes dataset
  # The metric values will be stored in the artifacts/inference/quality/metrics.txt file
  # Example:
  
  bash scripts/quality.sh $MODEL_FOLDER/artifacts/inference/results/ /workspace/Vitis-AI-Library/samples/yolov4/images/ --dataset
```

# Performance

- You can profile the model using [vaitrace](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1414-vitis-ai/Starting-a-Simple-Trace-with-vaitrace) perfomance report,
  the script and format described in the [Quick Start guide](../../../README.md#vaitrace) in the main Model Zoo.
- To get performance metrics (FPS, E2E, DPU_MEAN), use:
  ```bash
  # Format: bash scripts/performance.sh <MODEL_PATH> [<image paths list>]
  # where:
  # <MODEL_PATH> - the absolute path to the .xmodel
  # [<image paths list>] - space-separated list of image absolute paths
  # Alternatively, you can pass --dataset option with the folder where images are stored.
  # Example:

  bash scripts/performance.sh $MODEL_FOLDER/artifacts/models/yolov4_leaky_512_tf/yolov4_leaky_512_tf.xmodel --dataset /workspace/Vitis-AI-Library/samples/yolov4/images/
  ```
