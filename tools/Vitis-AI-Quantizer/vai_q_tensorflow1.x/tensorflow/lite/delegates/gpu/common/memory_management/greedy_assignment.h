// The problem of memory management is NP-complete. This implements a
// greedy algorithm that approximates an optimal solution with following
// heuristic:
//
//   1. Iterates through all tensor usage records and for every object
//   reference
//      assigns shared object from the pool. When object reference is used
//      for the last time, corresponding shared object is returned back to
//      the pool.
//
//   2. Shared object pool grows when there are no free shared object
//      available.
//
//   3. Shared object size may increase when tensor requests larger size.
