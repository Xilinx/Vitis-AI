# Micro Vision Example

This example shows how you can use Tensorflow Lite to run a 250 kilobyte neural
network to recognize people in images captured by a camera.  It is designed to
run on systems with small amounts of memory such as microcontrollers and DSPs.

## Getting Started

To compile and test this example on a desktop Linux or MacOS machine, download
[the TensorFlow source code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), `cd`
into the source directory from a terminal, and then run the following command:

```
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile
```

This will take a few minutes, and downloads frameworks the code uses like
[CMSIS](https://developer.arm.com/embedded/cmsis) and
[flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/). Once that process has
finished, run:

```
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=sparkfun_edge test_micro_vision
```

You should see a series of files get compiled, followed by some logging output
from a test, which should conclude with `~~~ALL TESTS PASSED~~~`. If you see
this, it means that a small program has been built and run that loads a trained
TensorFlow model, runs some example images through it, and got the expected
outputs. This particular test runs images with a and without a person in them,
and checks that the network correctly identifies them.

To understand how TensorFlow Lite does this, you can look at the `TestInvoke()`
function in
[micro_vision_test.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/examples/micro_vision/micro_vision_test.cc).
It's a fairly small amount of code, creating an interpreter, getting a handle to
a model that's been compiled into the program, and then invoking the interpreter
with the model and sample inputs.

## Running on a Microcontroller

The following instructions will help you build and deploy this sample on the
[SparkFun Edge development board](https://sparkfun.com/products/15170).  This
sample requires the Sparkfun himax camera for the Sparkfun Edge board.  It is
not available for purchase yet.

If you're new to using this board, we recommend walking through the
[AI on a microcontroller with TensorFlow Lite and SparkFun Edge](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sparkfun-tensorflow)
codelab to get an understanding of the workflow.

### Compile the binary

The following command will download the required dependencies and then compile a
binary for the SparkFun Edge:

```
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=sparkfun_edge micro_vision_bin
```

The binary will be created in the following location:

```
tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/sparkfun_edge_cortex-m4/bin/micro_vision.bin
```

### Sign the binary

The binary must be signed with cryptographic keys to be deployed to the device.
We'll now run some commands that will sign our binary so it can be flashed to
the SparkFun Edge. The scripts we are using come from the Ambiq SDK, which is
downloaded when the `Makefile` is run.

Enter the following command to set up some dummy cryptographic keys we can use
for development:

```
cp tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/downloads/AmbiqSuite-Rel2.0.0/tools/apollo3_scripts/keys_info0.py \
tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/downloads/AmbiqSuite-Rel2.0.0/tools/apollo3_scripts/keys_info.py
```

Next, run the following command to create a signed binary:

```
python3 tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/downloads/AmbiqSuite-Rel2.0.0/tools/apollo3_scripts/create_cust_image_blob.py \
--bin tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/sparkfun_edge_cortex-m4/bin/micro_vision.bin \
--load-address 0xC000 \
--magic-num 0xCB \
-o main_nonsecure_ota \
--version 0x0
```

This will create the file `main_nonsecure_ota.bin`. We'll now run another
command to create a final version of the file that can be used to flash our
device with the bootloader script we will use in the next step:

```
python3 tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/downloads/AmbiqSuite-Rel2.0.0/tools/apollo3_scripts/create_cust_wireupdate_blob.py \
--load-address 0x20000 \
--bin main_nonsecure_ota.bin \
-i 6 \
-o main_nonsecure_wire \
--options 0x1
```

You should now have a file called `main_nonsecure_wire.bin` in the directory
where you ran the commands. This is the file we'll be flashing to the device.

### Flash the binary

Next, attach the board to your computer via a USB-to-serial adapter.

**Note:** If you're using the [SparkFun Serial Basic Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15096),
you should [install the latest drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-serial-basic-ch340c-hookup-guide#drivers-if-you-need-them)
before you continue.

Once connected, assign the USB device name to an environment variable:

```
export DEVICENAME=put your device name here
```

Set another variable with the baud rate:

```
export BAUD_RATE=921600
```

Now, hold the button marked `14` on the device. While still holding the button,
hit the button marked `RST`. Continue holding the button marked `14` while
running the following command:

```
python3 tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/downloads/AmbiqSuite-Rel2.0.0/tools/apollo3_scripts/uart_wired_update.py \
-b ${BAUD_RATE} ${DEVICENAME} \
-r 1 \
-f main_nonsecure_wire.bin \
-i 6
```

You should see a long stream of output as the binary is flashed to the device.
Once you see the following lines, flashing is complete:

```
Sending Reset Command.
Done.
```

If you don't see these lines, flashing may have failed. Try running through the
steps in [Flash the binary](#flash-the-binary) again (you can skip over setting
the environment variables). If you continue to run into problems, follow the
[AI on a microcontroller with TensorFlow Lite and SparkFun Edge](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sparkfun-tensorflow)
codelab, which includes more comprehensive instructions for the flashing
process.

The binary should now be deployed to the device. Hit the button marked `RST` to
reboot the board. You should see the device's four LEDs flashing in sequence.

Debug information is logged by the board while the program is running. To view
it, establish a serial connection to the board using a baud rate of `115200`.
On OSX and Linux, the following command should work:

```
screen ${DEVICENAME} 115200
```

To stop viewing the debug output with `screen`, hit `Ctrl+A`, immediately
followed by the `K` key, then hit the `Y` key.

## Debugging Image Capture
When the sample is running, check the LEDs to determine whether the inference is
running correctly.  If the red light is stuck on, it means there was an error
communicating with the camera.  This is likely due to an incorrectly connected
or broken camera.

During inference, the blue LED will toggle every time inference is complete. The
orange LED indicates that no person was found, and the green LED indicates a
person was found. The red LED should never turn on, since it indicates an error.

In order to view the captured image, set the DUMP_IMAGE define in main.cc.Â  This
causes the board to log raw image info to the console. After the board has been
flashed and reset, dump the log to a text file:


```
screen -L -Logfile <dump file> ${DEVICENAME} 115200
```

Next, run the raw to bitmap converter to view captured images:

```
python3 raw_to_bitmap.py -r GRAY -i <dump file>
```
