    description: <<END
Tensor of shape `[..., 3, M]` whose innermost 2 dimensions represent the
tridiagonal matrices with three rows being the superdiagonal, diagonals, and
subdiagonals, in order. The last element of the superdiagonal and the first
element of the subdiagonal is ignored.

Tensor of shape `[..., M, K]`, representing K right-hand sides per each
left-hand side.

  summary: "Solves tridiagonal systems of equations."
  description: <<END
  Solves tridiagonal systems of equations.
  Supports batch dimensions and multiple right-hand sides per each left-hand
  side.
  On CPU, solution is computed via Gaussian elimination with or without partial
  pivoting, depending on `partial_pivoting` attribute. On GPU, Nvidia's cuSPARSE
  library is used: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparse/index.html#gtsv
