  summary:
    "Returns a batched diagonal tensor with given batched diagonal values."
  description: <<END
Returns a tensor with the contents in `diagonal` as `k[0]`-th to `k[1]`-th
diagonals of a matrix, with everything else padded with `padding`. `num_rows`
and `num_cols` specify the dimension of the innermost matrix of the output. If
both are not specified, the op assumes the innermost matrix is square and infers
its size from `k` and the innermost dimension of `diagonal`. If only one of them
is specified, the op assumes the unspecified value is the smallest possible
based on other criteria.

Let `diagonal` have `r` dimensions `[I, J, ..., L, M, N]`. The output tensor has
rank `r+1` with shape `[I, J, ..., L, M, num_rows, num_cols]` when only one
diagonal is given (`k` is an integer or `k[0] == k[1]`). Otherwise, it has rank
`r` with shape `[I, J, ..., L, num_rows, num_cols]`.

The second innermost dimension of `diagonal` has double meaning.
When `k` is scalar or `k[0] == k[1]`, `M` is part of the batch size
[I, J, ..., M], and the output tensor is:

```
output[i, j, ..., l, m, n]
  = diagonal[i, j, ..., l, n-max(d_upper, 0)] ; if n - m == d_upper
    output[i, j, ..., l, m, n]                ; otherwise
```

Otherwise, `M` is treated as the number of diagonals for the matrix in the
same batch (`M = k[1]-k[0]+1`), and the output tensor is:

```
output[i, j, ..., l, m, n]
  = diagonal[i, j, ..., l, k[1]-d, n-max(d, 0)] ; if d_lower <= d <= d_upper
    input[i, j, ..., l, m, n]                   ; otherwise
```
where `d = n - m`
