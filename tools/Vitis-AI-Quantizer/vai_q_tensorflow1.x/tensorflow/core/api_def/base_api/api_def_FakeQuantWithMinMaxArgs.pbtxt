  summary: "Fake-quantize the \'inputs\' tensor, type float to \'outputs\' tensor of same type."
  description: <<END
Attributes `[min; max]` define the clamping range for the `inputs` data.
`inputs` values are quantized into the quantization range (`[0; 2^num_bits - 1]`
when `narrow_range` is false and `[1; 2^num_bits - 1]` when it is true) and
then de-quantized and output as floats in `[min; max]` interval.
`num_bits` is the bitwidth of the quantization; between 2 and 16, inclusive.

Before quantization, `min` and `max` values are adjusted with the following
logic.
It is suggested to have `min <= 0 <= max`. If `0` is not in the range of values,
the behavior can be unexpected:
If `0 < min < max`: `min_adj = 0` and `max_adj = max - min`.
If `min < max < 0`: `min_adj = min - max` and `max_adj = 0`.
If `min <= 0 <= max`: `scale = (max - min) / (2^num_bits - 1) `,
`min_adj = scale * round(min / scale)` and `max_adj = max + min_adj - min`.

Quantization is called fake since the output is still in floating point.
