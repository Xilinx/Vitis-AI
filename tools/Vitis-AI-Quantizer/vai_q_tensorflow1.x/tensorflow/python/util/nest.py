"""## Functions for working with arbitrarily nested sequences of elements.

This module can perform operations on nested structures. A nested structure is a
Python sequence, tuple (including `namedtuple`), or dict that can contain
further sequences, tuples, and dicts.

attr.s decorated classes (http://www.attrs.org) are also supported, in the
same way as `namedtuple`.

The utilities here assume (and do not check) that the nested structures form a
'tree', i.e., no references in the structure of the input of these functions
should be recursive.

Example structures: `((3, 4), 5, (6, 7, (9, 10), 8))`, `(np.array(0),
  (np.array([3, 4]), tf.constant([3, 4])))`

    **kwargs: kwargs to feed to func(). Special kwarg
      `check_types` is not passed to func, but instead determines whether the
      types of iterables within the structures have to be same (e.g.
      `map_structure(func, [1], (1,))` raises a `TypeError` exception). To allow
      this set this argument to `False`.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If `shallow_tree` is a sequence but one of `*inputs` is not.

    ValueError: If the sequence lengths of `shallow_tree` are different from
