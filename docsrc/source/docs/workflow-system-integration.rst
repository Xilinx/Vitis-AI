DPU IP Details and System Integration
-------------------------------------


About the DPU IP
================

AMD uses the acronym D-P-U to identify soft accelerators that target deep-learning inference. These “**D** eep Learning **P** rocessing **U** nits” are a vital component of the Vitis AI solution. This (perhaps overloaded) term can refer to one of several potential accelerator architectures covering multiple network topologies.

A DPU comprises elements available in the AMD programmable logic fabric, such as DSP, BlockRAM, UltraRAM, LUTs, and Flip-Flops, or may be developed as a set of microcoded functions that are deployed on the AMD AI Engine, or “AI Engine” architecture. Furthermore, in the case of some applications, the DPU is likely to be comprised of programmable logic and AI Engine array resources.

An example of the DPUCZ, targeting Zynq |trade| Ultrascale+ |trade| devices is displayed in the following image:

Vitis AI DPUs are general-purpose AI inference accelerators. A single DPU instance in your design can enable you to deploy multiple CNNs simultaneously and process multiple streams simultaneously. The Processing depends on the DPU having sufficient parallelism to support the combination of the networks and the number of streams. Multiple DPU instances can be instantiated per device. The DPU can be scaled in size to accommodate the requirements of the user.

The Vitis AI DPU architecture is called a "Matrix of (Heterogeneous) Processing Engines."  While on the surface, Vitis AI DPU architectures have some visual similarity to a systolic array; the similarity ends there. DPU is a micro-coded processor with its Instruction Set Architecture. Each DPU architecture has its own instruction set, and the Vitis AI Compiler compiles an executable ``.Xmodel`` to deploy for each network. The DPU executes the compiled instructions in the ``.Xmodel``. The Vitis AI Runtime addresses the underlying tasks of scheduling the inference of multiple networks, multiple streams, and even multiple DPU instances. The mix of processing engines in the DPU is heterogeneous, with the DPU having different engines specialized for different tasks. For instance, CONV2D operators are accelerated in a purpose-built PE, while another process depthwise convolutions.

One advantage of this architecture is that there is no need to load a new bitstream or build a new hardware platform while changing the network.  This is an important differentiator from Data Flow accelerator architectures that are purpose-built for a single network.  That said, both the Matrix of Processing Engines and Data Flow architectures have a place in AMD designs.  If you need a highly optimized, specialized Data Flow accelerator for inference, refer to the `FINN & Brevitas  <https://xilinx.github.io/finn/>`__ solutions.  Data Flow architectures based on FINN can support inference at line rates for high-speed communications and extremely high sample rates for inference in the RF domain.  Neither of these two applications is a great fit for Vitis AI.  The reality is that both of these flows are complementary, and support for both can play an essential role in customer product differentiation and future-proofing.

Vitis AI DPU IP and Reference Designs
=====================================

Today, AMD DPU IPs are not incorporated into the standard Vivado |trade| IP catalog and instead, the DPU IP is released embedded in a reference design.  Users can start with the reference design and modify it to suit their requirements.  The reference designs are fully functional and can be used as a template for IP integration and connectivity as well as Linux integration.

The DPU IP is also is released as a separate download that can be incorporated into a new or existing design by the developer.


DPU Nomenclature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a variety of different DPUs available for different tasks and AMD platforms. The following decoder helps extract the features, characteristics, and target hardware platforms from a given DPU name.

.. image:: reference/images/dpu_nomenclature_current.PNG

Historic DPU Nomenclature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of the Vitis |trade| 1.2 release, the historic DPUv1/v2/v3 nomenclature was deprecated. To better understand how these historic DPU names map into the current nomenclature, refer to the following table:

.. image:: reference/images/dpu_nomenclature_legacy_mapping.PNG

DPU Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

high-speed interfaces that can provide superior performance/watt over conventional FPGAs,
CPUs, and GPUs. The DPUCVDX8H is implemented on Versal devices to leverage these benefits.
You can configure the parameters to meet your data center application requirements.

Version and Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the user must incorporate the IP into the Vivado IP catalog themselves, it is very important to understand that the designs and IP in the table below were verified with specific versions of Vivado, Vitis, Petalinux and Vitis AI.  Please refer to :ref:`Version Compatibility <version-compatibility>` for additional information.

.. note:: It is anticipated that users may wish to leverage the latest release of Vitis AI, Vitis or Vivado with DPU IP that has not been updated in this release.  For Adaptable SoC targets it is anticipated that the latest Vitis AI components such as Model Zoo models, Petalinux recipes, Quantizer, Compiler, VART and the Vitis AI Library can be directly leveraged by the user.  However, updated reference designs will no longer be provided for minor (x.5) Vitis AI releases for MPSoC and Versal AI Core targets.  Users are encouraged to use Vitis AI 3.0 for evaluation of those targets, and migrate to the Vitis AI 3.5 release if desired or necessary for production.

The table below associates currently available DPU IP with the supported target, and provides links to download the reference design and documentation.  For convenience, a separate IP repo is provided for users who do not wish to download the reference design.  The IP is thus included both in the reference design, but also is available as a separate download.

.. _integrating-the-dpu:

Integrating the DPU
===================

The basic steps to build a platform that integrates a Vitis |trade| AI DPU are as follows:

1. A custom hardware platform is built using the Vitis software platform based on the Vitis
Target Platform. The generated hardware includes the DPU IP and other kernels. You can
also use the AMD Vitis |trade| or Vivado |trade| flows to integrate the DPU and build the custom hardware
to suit your need.

2. The Vitis AI toolchain in the host machine is used to build the model. It takes the pre-trained
floating models as the input and runs them through the AI Optimizer (optional), AI Quantizer and AI Compiler.

3. You can build executable software which runs on the built hardware. You can write your
applications with C++ or Python which calls the Vitis AI Runtime and Vitis AI Library to load
and run the compiled model files.

.. _vitis-integration:

Vitis Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Vitis |trade| workflow specifically targets developers with a software-centric approach to AMD SoC system development. Vitis AI is differentiated from traditional FPGA flows, enabling you to build FPGA acceleration into your applications without developing RTL kernels.

The Vitis workflow enables the integration of the DPU IP as an acceleration kernel that is loaded at runtime in the form of an ``xclbin`` file. To provide developers with a reference platform that can be used as a starting point. For the DPUCV2DX8G, please refer to the VEK280 reference design included in this release.  For MPSoC and Versal AI Core (non AIE-ML devices) please refer to the /dpu subdirectory in the Vitis AI 3.0 Github repository.

In addition, a Vitis tutorial is available which provides the `end-to-end workflow <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/tree/2023.1/Vitis_Platform_Creation/Design_Tutorials/02-Edge-AI-ZCU104>`__ for creating a Vitis Platform for ZCU104 targets.

.. figure:: reference/images/vitis_integration.PNG
   :width: 1300


.. _vivado-integration:

Vivado Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Vivado |trade| workflow targets traditional FPGA developers. It is important to note that the DPU IP is not currently integrated into the Vivado IP catalog. Currently, in order to update support the latest operators and network topologies at the time of Vitis AI release, the IP is released asynchronously as a reference design and IP repository.

For more information, refer to the following resources:

-  To integrate the DPU in a Vivado design, see this `tutorial <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI-Tutorials/blob/2.0/Tutorials/Vitis-AI-Vivado-TRD/>`__.

-  A quick-start example that assists you in deploying VART on Embedded targets is available `here <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/v3.5/src/vai_runtime/quick_start_for_embedded.md>`__.

.. figure:: reference/images/vivado_integration.PNG
   :width: 1300

.. _linux-dpu-recipes:

Vitis AI Linux Recipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yocto and PetaLinux users will require bitbake recipes for the Vitis AI components that are compiled for the target. These recipes are provided in the `source code folder <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/v3.5/src/vai_petalinux_recipes>`__.


.. important:: For Vitis AI releases >= v2.0, Vivado users (Zynq |reg| Ultrascale+ |trade| and Kria |trade| applications) must compile VART standalone without XRT. However, Vitis users must compile VART with XRT (required for Vitis kernel integration). All designs that leverage Vitis AI require VART, while all Alveo and Versal |reg| designs must include XRT. By default, the Vitis AI Docker images incorporate XRT. Perhaps most important is that the Linux bitbake recipe for VART `assumes <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/v3.5/src/vai_petalinux_recipes/recipes-vitis-ai/vart/vart_3.5.bb#L17>`__ by default that you are leveraging the Vitis flow. If you are leveraging the DPU in Vivado with Linux, you must either leverage ``vart_3.5_vivado.bb`` and rename it ``vart_3.5.bb`` or, comment out the line ``PACKAGECONFIG:append = " vitis"`` in the ``vart_3.5.bb`` recipe in order to ensure that you are compiling VART without XRT. Failing to do so will result in runtime errors when executing VART APIs. Specifically, XRT, which is not compatible with Vivado will error out when it attempts to load an xclbin file, a kernel file that is absent in the Vivado flow.  Finally, be sure to only include one of the two bitbake recipes in the Petalinux build folder! 


There are two ways to integrate the Vitis |trade| AI Library and Runtime in a custom design:

- Build the Linux image using Petalinux, incorporating the necessary recipes.

- Install Vitis AI 3.5 to the target leveraging a pre-built package at run time.  For details of this procedure, please see the instructions in the Vitis AI Online Installation section below.


.. _vart_vail_online_install:

Vitis AI Online Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runtime
+++++++

If you have an updated version of the Vitis AI Runtime (perhaps you have made changes to the source code) and simply wish to install the update to your target without rebuilding Petalinux, follow these steps.

   -  Copy the board_setup/[TARGET] folder to the board using scp, where [TARGET] = {mpsoc, vck190, vek280} and [IP_OF_TARGET] is the IP address of the target board.

      .. code-block:: Bash

         scp -r board_setup/[TARGET] root@[IP_OF_TARGET]:~/

   -  Log in to the board using ssh. You can also use the serial port to login.
   -  Now, install the Vitis AI Runtime. 
   
      .. code-block:: Bash
		
		cd ~/[TARGET]
		bash target_vart_setup.sh

Library
+++++++


.. note:: Vitis AI RPM packages will not be available until 1-3 months following the Vitis AI release.  Due to historic problems with this delay and the impact on this workflow, we will update this section of the documentation once the package is available.  Please check back on Github.IO for the latest update or `email us <amd_ai_mkt@amd.com>`__ for updates if this page is not updated prior to August 15,2023.


Optimization for MPSoC Targets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For custom MPSOC targets you can optionally run ``zynqmp_dpu_optimize.sh`` to optimize board settings.

   The script runs automatically after the board boots up with the official image. But you can also find the ``dpu_sw_optimize.tar.gz`` in `DPUCZDX8G.tar.gz <https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=DPUCZDX8G.tar.gz>`__.

   .. code-block:: Bash

       cd ~/dpu_sw_optimize/zynqmp/
       ./zynqmp_dpu_optimize.sh
	   

Linux Devicetree Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the PetaLinux flow, the Linux Devicetree nodes for the DPU are automatically generated.  If modifications are made to the DPU IP parameters in the hardware design, changes to the .xsa must be propagated to PetaLinux in order to ensure that the corresponding changes to the Devicetree bindings are propagated to the software platform.

It is recognized that not all users will leverage PetaLinux.  Users choosing to deviate from the PetaLinux flow (eg, Yocto users) may require additional resources.  The following are suggested for additional reading:

#. `Build the Devicetree Compiler <https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841988/Build+Device+Tree+Compiler+dtc>`__
#. `Debugging Devicetree Issues <https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/341082130/Quick+guide+to+Debugging+Device+Tree+Generator+Issues>`__

In addition, it is worth noting that documentation for the Vitis AI DPUCZ Devicetree bindings can be `found here <https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/misc/xlnx%2Cdpu.yaml>`__ .  These are relevant only to the DPUCZ.

Rebuilding the Linux Image With Petalinux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most developers will need to build a Petalinux or Yocto Vitis AI 3.5 image for their platform. You can obtain the recipes for Vitis AI 3.5 in the following two ways:

-  Using ``recipes-vitis-ai`` in this repo.
-  Upgrading the Petalinux eSDK.

Using recipes-vitis-ai
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::
     
   ``recipes-vitis-ai`` enables **Vitis flow by default**. Recipes for both Vivado and Vitis are provided. In the Vivado recipe, the following line is commented out:

   ..  code-block:: bash

        #PACKAGECONFIG_append = " vitis"

1. Copy the ``recipes-vitis-ai`` folder to ``<petalinux project>/project-spec/meta-user/``

   ..  code-block:: bash

      cp Vitis-AI/src/petalinux_recipes/recipes-vitis-ai <petalinux project>/project-spec/meta-user/


2. Delete either ``recipes-vitis-ai/vart/vart_3.5.bb`` or ``recipes-vitis-ai/vart/vart_3.5_vivado.bb`` depending on workflow that you have selected for your design.  If you use ``recipes-vitis-ai/vart/vart_3.5_vivado.bb`` please rename it ``recipes-vitis-ai/vart/vart_3.5.bb``.


3. Edit ``<petalinux project>/project-spec/meta-user/conf/user-rootfsconfig``
   file, appending the following lines:

   .. code-block::

         CONFIG_vitis-ai-library
         CONFIG_vitis-ai-library-dev
         CONFIG_vitis-ai-library-dbg

4. Source PetaLinux tool and run ``petalinux-config -c rootfs`` command. Select the following option.

   .. code-block::

         Select user packages --->
         Select [*] vitis-ai-library

   Then, save it and exit.

5. Run ``petalinux-build``.

   .. note:
      
      After you run the above successfully, the vitis-ai-library, VART3.5 and the dependent packages will all be installed into the rootfs image.

      If you want to compile the example on the target, please select the ``vitis-ai-library-dev`` and ``packagegroup-petalinux-self-hosted``. Then, recompile the system.

      If you want to use vaitracer tool, please select the ``vitis-ai-library-dbg``. And copy ``recipes-vai-kernel`` folder to ``<petalinux project>/project-spec/meta-user/``. Then, recompile the system.

   ..  code-block:: bash

       cp Vitis-AI/src/petalinux_recipes/recipes-vai-kernel <petalinux project>/project-spec/meta-user/

Using Upgrade Petalinux eSDK
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run the following commands to upgrade PetaLinux.

.. code-block:: bash

     source <petalinux-v2023.1>/settings
     petalinux-upgrade -u ‘http://petalinux.xilinx.com/sswreleases/rel-v2023/sdkupdate/2023.1_update1/’ -p ‘aarch64’

Following this upgrade, you will find ``vitis-ai-library_3.5.bb`` recipe in ``<petalinux project>/components/yocto/layers/meta-vitis-ai``.

For details about this process, refer to `Petalinux Upgrade <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide/petalinux-upgrade>`__.

.. note:: ``2023.1_update1`` will be released approximately 1 month after Vitis 3.5 release. The name of ``2023.1_update1`` may change. Modify it accordingly.

Model Memory Requirements and the Linux CMA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contiguous memory is required for the deployment of models on the DPU.  It is thus important that developers understand that they have to allocate memory accordingly.  If this is not evaluated, the user may find that model deployment fails.  One sign that this is a problem is that an error is issued when attempting to execute the model.  Below is an example:

   ..  code-block:: bash

		Out of memory: Killed process 12349 (python3) total-vm:1943752kB, anon-rss:1142200kB, file-rss:1284kB, shmem-rss:0kB, UID:0 pgtables:3808kB oom_score_adj:0
		Out of memory: Killed process


This section provides guidelines on estimating the CMA memory space required for model deployment. To perform this estimation, you will need to run `xdputil` on the neural network of interest. 

   ..  code-block:: bash

       $ xdputil xmodel ./somemodel.xmodel  -l  

The ``reg info`` section of the output of this command provides details of various registers and their corresponding sizes. 
 
       ..  code-block:: bash
       		
		...  
       		"reg info":[
				{
					"name":"REG_0",
					"context type":"CONST",
					"size":5310976
				},
				{
					"name":"REG_1",
					"context type":"WORKSPACE",
					"size":2182976
				},
				{
					"name":"REG_2",
					"context type":"DATA_LOCAL_INPUT",
					"size":150528
				},
				{
					"name":"REG_3",
					"context type":"DATA_LOCAL_OUTPUT",
					"size":1024
				}
			],
			"instruction reg":45600

 
Here is what each register represents:

•	``REG_0`` with context type ``CONST`` refers to the weights and biases used in the model.
•	``REG_1`` with context type ``WORKSPACE`` refers to the space required to store intermediate results.
•	``REG_2`` with context type ``DATA_LOCAL_INPUT`` refers to the space required by the input.
•	``REG_3`` with context type ``DATA_LOCAL_OUTPUT`` refers to the space required by the output.

The ``instruction reg`` value represents the space required by the DPU (Deep Learning Processing Unit) instructions. All sizes are specified in bytes.

.. note:: Some large networks may have additional registers (for example, ``REG_4``, ``REG_5``). The ``context type`` indicates the kind of space required.  If additional registers are listed, the developer must incorporate these into their assessment.

For the formulas provided below, the following additional terms must be defined:

•	`T` threads represent the number of model instances (usually 1 instance per thread).
•	`dpu_cores` indicate the number of DPU cores. If the number of model instances is less than the number of DPU cores, not all the DPU cores are used. The value of `dpu_cores` is calculated as the minimum of the number of DPU cores and the number of model instances.

`dpu_cores` = min (number of dpu cores, number of single model instances)

In the formulas below, note that:

•	`const_space` = ``CONST`` space
•	`work_space` = sum of all ``WORKSPACE`` space
•	`in_space` = sum of all ``DATA_LOCAL_INPUT`` values
•	`out_space` = sum of all ``DATA_LOCAL_OUTPUT`` values
•	`instr_space` = ``instruction reg`` space

.. note:: When using the DPUCZDX8G IP, am additional fixed chunk of 5MB CMA memory is required if the user enables hardware Softmax.


Example 1:
++++++++++

When running `B` batches with `T` threads and `D` dpu_cores the required CMA can be computed as follows:

CMA (min required) = `const_space` + `instr_space` + `B` * (`D` * `work_space` + `T` * (`in_space` + `out_space`))

Example 2:
++++++++++

When running two neural networks (model1 and model2) with `B` batches, `D` dpu_cores, `T1` threads for model1, and `T2` threads for model2, the required CMA can be computed as follows:

.. note:: Use `xdputil` to run each model. D1 & D2 need to be calculated separately.

1.	CMA (min required for model1) = `const_space1` + `instr_space1` + `B` * (`D1` * `work_space1` + `T1` * (`in_space1` + `out_space1`))
2.	CMA (min required for model2) = `const_space2` + `instr_space2` + `B` * (`D2` * `work_space2` + `T2` * (`in_space2` + `out_space2`))
3.	CMA (min total) = required CMA for model1 + required CMA for model2
