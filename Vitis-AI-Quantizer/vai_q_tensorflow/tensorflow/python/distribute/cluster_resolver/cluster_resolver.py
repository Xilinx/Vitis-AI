  """Abstract class for all implementations of ClusterResolvers.

  This defines the skeleton for all implementations of ClusterResolvers.
  ClusterResolvers are a way for TensorFlow to communicate with various cluster
  management systems (e.g. GCE, AWS, etc...).

  By letting TensorFlow communicate with these systems, we will be able to
  automatically discover and resolve IP addresses for various TensorFlow
  workers. This will eventually allow us to automatically recover from
  underlying machine failures and scale TensorFlow worker clusters up and down.

  Note to Implementors: In addition to these abstract methods, you must also
  implement the task_type, task_id, and rpc_layer attributes. You may choose
  to implement them either as properties with getters or setters or directly
  set the attributes.

  - task_type is the name of the server's current named job (e.g. 'worker',
     'ps' in a distributed parameterized training job).
  - task_id is the ordinal index of the server within the task type.
  - rpc_layer is the protocol used by TensorFlow to communicate with other
      TensorFlow servers in a distributed environment.
