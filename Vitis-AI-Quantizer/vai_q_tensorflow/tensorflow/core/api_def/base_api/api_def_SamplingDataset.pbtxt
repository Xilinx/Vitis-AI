  summary: "Creates a dataset that takes a Bernoulli sample of the contents of another dataset."
  description: <<END
There is no transformation in the `tf.data` Python API for creating this dataset.
Instead, it is created as a result of the `filter_with_random_uniform_fusion`
static optimization. Whether this optimization is performed is determined by the
`experimental_optimization.filter_with_random_uniform_fusion` option of
`tf.data.Options`.
