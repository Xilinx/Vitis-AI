  summary: "Creates a dataset that shards the input dataset."
  description: <<END
Creates a dataset that shards the input dataset by num_workers, returning a
sharded dataset for the index-th worker. This attempts to automatically shard
a dataset by examining the Dataset graph and inserting a shard op before the
inputs to a reader Dataset (e.g. CSVDataset, TFRecordDataset).

This dataset will throw a NotFound error if we cannot shard the dataset
automatically.
