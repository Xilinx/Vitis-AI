Read
[the section on segmentation](https://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math#Segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

Computes a tensor such that
\\(output_i = \sum_j data_j\\) where sum is over `j` such
that `segment_ids[j] == i`.

If the sum is empty for a given segment ID `i`, `output[i] = 0`.

For example:

```
c = tf.constant([[1,2,3,4], [4, 3, 2, 1], [5,6,7,8]])
tf.segment_sum(c, tf.constant([0, 0, 1]))
# ==> [[5, 5, 5, 5],
#      [5, 6, 7, 8]]
```
