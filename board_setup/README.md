## Target Board Setup

The Vitis-AI repository provides pre-built board images that can be leveraged by users who wish to test-drive the Vitis-AI workflow, run examples and evaluate models from the Model Zoo.  This directory provides the necessary scripts and files that will enable usage of these targets.

As of the 3.0 release of Vitis AI, the target setup documentation has migrated to Github.IO.  **YOU MAY ACCESS THE TARGET SETUP DOCUMENTATION [ONLINE](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/docs/board_setup/board_setup.html)** or **[OFFLINE](../docs/docs/board_setup/board_setup.html)**.

For additional high-level details please refer to the [workflow documentation](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/docs/workflow.html#test-drive-vitis-ai-on-a-supported-platform).
