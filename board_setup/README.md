## Target Board Setup

The Vitis-AI repository provides pre-built board images that can be leveraged by users who wish to test-drive the Vitis AI workflow, run examples and evaluate models from the Model Zoo.  This directory provides the necessary scripts and files that will enable usage of these targets.

As of the 3.5 release of Vitis AI, the target setup documentation has migrated to Github.IO and is integrated into the Quickstart tutorials.  **[PLEASE ACCESS THE LATEST QUICKSTART DOCUMENTATION ONLINE](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI)** or **[OPEN THE OFFLINE DOCUMENTATION IN YOUR BROWSER](../docs/docs/index.html)**.
