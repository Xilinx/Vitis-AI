# Whole Application Acceleration: Accelerating ML Pre/Post-processing for Classification and Detection networks

## Introduction

These examples demonstrate how Xilinx® [Vitis Vision library](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/tree/master/vision) functions can be integrated with deep neural network (DNN) accelerator to achieve complete application acceleration. This application focuses on accelerating the pre/post-processing involved in inference of object detection & classification networks.

## Background

Input images are preprocessed  before being fed for inference of different deep neural networks. The pre-processing steps vary from network to network. For example, for classification networks like Resnet-50 the input image is resized to 224 x 224 size and then channel-wise mean subtraction is performed before feeding the data to the DNN accelerator. For detection networks like YOLO v3 the input image is resized to 256 x 512 size using letterbox before feeding the data to the DNN accelerator. Similarly, some networks like SSD-Mobilenet also require the inference output to be processed to filter out unncessary data. Non Maximum Supression (NMS) is an example of post-processing function.


[Vitis Vision library](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/tree/master/vision) provides functions optimized for FPGA devices that are drop-in replacements for standard OpenCV library functions. These application demonstrates how Vitis Vision library functions can be used to accelerate the complete application.
