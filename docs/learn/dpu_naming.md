# DPU Naming

Vitis AI 1.2 introduces a new DPU naming scheme. This new naming scheme will help you select the right DPU for your application or platform, by highlighting the characteristics of each DPU.

The old DPUv1/v2/v3 naming will be deprecated.  

Refer to the guide below to understand the available DPU options.

We may have new DPUs available in the near future. The fields of the DPU naming can be expanded and updated accordingly.
<br />

## DPU Naming Example

To better understand how to map the old DPU names into this naming, refer to the following table.
