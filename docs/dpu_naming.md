## DPU Naming

Vitis AI 1.2 introduces a new DPU naming scheme. This new naming scheme will help users select the right DPU for their application or platform, by highlighting each DPUs characteristics.

The old DPUv1/v2/v3 naming will be deprecated.  

Please refer to the guide below to understand the availble DPU options.
