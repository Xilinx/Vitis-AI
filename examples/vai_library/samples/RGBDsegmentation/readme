Important:
  ./test_jpeg_RGBDsegmentation, ./test_performance_RGBDsegmentation first param followed must be with model name.
  Valid model name:
    SA_gate_base_pt

1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.

    sample : ./test_jpeg_RGBDsegmentation SA_gate_base_pt sample_rgbdsegmentation_bgr.jpg sample_rgbdsegmentation_hha.jpg
    output :
        The result is written in SA_gate_base_pt_result.png
        The result is written in SA_gate_base_pt_color_result.png

Performance: 
    ./test_performance_RGBDsegmentation SA_gate_base_pt test_performance_RGBDsegmentation.list -s 60 -t <thread> 


Accuracy:
    ./test_accuracy_RGBDsegmentation  <model_name> <RGB_image_path> <HHA_image_path> <image_list_file>  <output_filename>

    sample:
    ./test_accuracy_RGBDsegmentation SA_gate_base_pt val_image_RGB/ val_image_HHA/  image_list.txt result.txt
