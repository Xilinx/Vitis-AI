Important:
  ./test_jpeg_rcan, ./test_performance_rcan, ./test_video_rcan first param followed must be with model name.
  Valid model name:
    rcan_pruned_tf
    SESR_S_pt
    ofa_rcan_latency_pt
    xilinxSR_pt

1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.
