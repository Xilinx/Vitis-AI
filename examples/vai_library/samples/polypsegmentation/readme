Important:
  ./test_jpeg_polypsegmentation, ./test_performance_polypsegmentation, ./test_video_polypsegmentation first param followed must be with model name.
  Valid model name:
    HardNet_MSeg_pt


1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.
    
    sample : ./test_jpeg_polypsegmentation HardNet_MSeg_pt sample_polypsegmentation.png
    output :



Performance: 
    ./test_performance_polypsegmentation HardNet_MSeg_pt test_performance_polypsegmentation.list -s 60 -t <thread> 


Accuracy:
    ./test_accuracy_polypsegmentation_mt <model_name> <image_list_filename> <output_filename>

    sample:
    ./test_accuracy_polypsegmentation_mt HardNet_MSeg_pt image_list.txt result.txt
