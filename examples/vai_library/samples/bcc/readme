Important:
  ./test_jpeg_bcc 
  ./test_video_bcc 
  ./test_performance_bcc 
  ./test_accuracy_bcc

1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.
    
    sample : ./test_jpeg_bcc bcc_pt sample_bcc.jpg
    output : 2062

    sample : ./test_performance_bcc bcc_pt -t 4 -s 20 test_performance_bcc.list



Performance: 
    ./test_performance_bcc bcc_pt test_performance_bcc.list -s 60 -t <thread> 


Accuracy:
    ./test_accuracy_bcc <model_name> <image_list_filename> <output_filename>

    or you can use multi-thread to test, like:

    ./test_accuracy_bcc_mt <model_name> <image_list_filename> <output_filename> -t <thread>

    sample:
    ./test_accuracy_bcc bcc_pt image_list.txt result.txt 
    ./test_accuracy_bcc_mt bcc_pt image_list.txt result.txt -t 2
