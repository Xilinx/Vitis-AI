Important:
  ./test_jpeg_posedetect, ./test_performance_posedetect, ./test_video_posedetect first param followed must be with model name.
  Valid model name:
    sp_net


1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.
