Important:
  ./test_jpeg_3Dsegmentation, ./test_performance_3Dsegmentation first param followed must be with model name.
  Valid model name:
    salsanext_pt
    salsanext_v2_pt


1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.
    
    sample : ./test_jpeg_3Dsegmentation salsanext_pt  scan_x.txt scan_y.txt scan_z.txt scan_remission.txt
    ./test_performance_3Dsegmentation salsanext_pt test_performance_3Dsegmentation.list  -t 4 -s 60(Please copy the folder salsanext_input/ in the current directory)

    sample : ./test_jpeg_3Dsegmentation salsanext_v2_pt  scan_x.txt scan_y.txt scan_z.txt scan_remission.txt
    output :



Performance: 
    ./test_performance_3Dsegmentation salsanext_pt test_performance_3Dsegmentation.list -s 60 -t <thread> 
    ./test_performance_3Dsegmentation salsanext_v2_pt test_performance_3Dsegmentation.list -s 60 -t <thread> 


Accuracy:
    ./test_accuracy_3Dsegmentation <model_name> <image_list_filename> <output_filename>

    sample:
    ./test_accuracy_3Dsegmentation salsanext_pt image_list.txt result.txt
    ./test_accuracy_3Dsegmentation salsanext_v2_pt image_list.txt result.txt
