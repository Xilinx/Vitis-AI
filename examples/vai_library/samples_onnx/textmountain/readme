Important:

  add environment parameter DEBUG_USE_NEW_SCHEDULE=0 before executable files.

  ./test_textmountain_onnx, ./test_performance_textmountain_onnx, ./test_accuracy_textmountain_onnx first param followed must be with model name.
  Valid model name:
    textmountain_onnx_pt

1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.

    sample : ./test_textmountain_onnx /usr/share/vitis_ai_library/models/textmountain_onnx_pt/textmountain_onnx_pt.onnx sample_textmountain.jpg
