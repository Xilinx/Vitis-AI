Important:
  ./test_jpeg_medicalsegmentation 
  ./test_performance_medicalsegmentation 
  ./test_accuracy_medicalsegmentation

1, compile

    execute the following command:

        sh build.sh

2, copy the compiled executable file and test image to the development board.

   run the executable file.
    
    sample : ./test_jpeg_medicalsegmentation FPN_Res18_Medical_segmentation sample_medicalsegmentation.jpg
    output : cv::Mat in results directory

    sample : ./test_performance_medicalsegmentation FPN_Res18_Medical_segmentationv-t 4 -s 20   test_performance_medicalsegmentation.list

    sample : ./test_accuracy_medicalsegmentation FPN_Res18_Medical_segmentation acc_test_medicalsegmentation.list

 

Accuracy:
    ./test_accuracy_medicalsegmentation_mt <model_name> <image_list_filename> <output_filename> -t <thread>
