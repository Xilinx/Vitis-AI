## Introduction
In this example, application with accelerated pre-processing using AIE kernels is providied for classification networks (Resnet-50). This application can run VCK190 platform. In this application, pre-processsing functions, including resize and normalization, are hardware accelerated and the output of the pre-processing is fed as input to the ML accelerator. The following image shows the inference pipeline.

</div>

:pushpin: **Note:** Currently, in this application, the pre-processing accelerator only supports full-HD image resolution.

## Setting the SD Card and Running Resnet50 example
---
Setting the SD card for running Resnet50 example on vck190 can be done in two different ways: 
1. Using pre-built xclbin 
1. Build flow

In the first approach, an existing xclbin and sd_card.img are used, whereas in the second approach fresh xclbin and sd_card.img are built following build flow. 

Once the SD card is set with the image file, running Resnet50 example is common in both the approaches.

### **1. Using pre-built xclbin**
In this approach, an existing sd_card.img file containing the xclbin, including the pre-processing accelerator and DPU, is used.
#### *Setting up VCK190 platform with the pre-built image*

* Download the VCK190 SD card image file using the below link
    
    [VCK190](https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/design-license-xef.html?filename=waa_vck190_resnet50_waa_aie_v2_5_0.img.gz)

  Please note that Xilinx account sign-in is required to download the above file.
* Unzip the file and flash the `sd_card.img` file on the SD card using tools like Etcher.

### **2. Build flow**
The pre-processing accelerator and DPU are built from sources following the build flow.

| Build flow                    | Device          | Documentation                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DPUCVDX8G  | VCK190      | [DPUCVDX8G_vck190](./build_flow/DPUCVDX8G_vck190/README.md)            |

Once the sd card is flashed with sd_card.img file, either by using pre-built xclbin flow or build flow, cross-compilation is performed, followed by running the application. 
### **Cross-compile Resnet50 example**
  * Download the [sdk-2022.1.0.0.sh](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=sdk-2022.1.0.0.sh).

  * Install the cross-compilation system environment, follow the prompts to install. 

    **Please install it on your local host linux system.**
    ```sh
    ./sdk-2022.1.0.0.sh
    ```
    Note that the `~/petalinux_sdk` path is recommended for the installation. Regardless of the path you choose for the installation, make sure the path has read-write permissions.
     
    Here, we install it under `~/petalinux_sdk`.

  * When the installation is complete, executing the following command will set cross-compilation environment. The environment is set in the next step.
    ```sh
    source ~/petalinux_sdk/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
    ```
    Note that if you close the current terminal, you need to re-execute the above instructions in the new terminal interface.

  * Cross compile `resnet50_waa_aie` example.
    ```sh
    source < vitis-install-directory >/Vitis/2022.1/settings64.sh
    source < path-to-XRT-installation-directory >/setenv.sh
    export SYSROOT=<path to sysroot>/sysroots/aarch64-xilinx-linux/
    unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    source ~/petalinux_sdk/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
    export CROSS_COMPILE_ENV=~/petalinux_sdk/sysroots/cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux/
    cd  ${VAI_HOME}/examples/Whole-App-Acceleration/apps/resnet50_waa_aie
    bash -x app_build.sh
    ```
      If the compilation process does not report any error and the executable file `./bin/resnet50_waa_aie.exe` is generated , then the host environment is installed correctly.

### **Run Resnet50 Example**
  This section gives details to run the Resnet50 example on vck190 board.

  * Download/copy your full-HD images to ` ${VAI_HOME}/examples/Whole-App-Acceleration/apps/resnet50_waa_aie/img` directory.

  * Download the Vitis-AI runtime

    ```sh
    wget https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0.tar.gz -O vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0.tar.gz

    tar -xzvf vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0.tar.gz
    ```
  * Download model files for Resnet50
    ```sh  
    cd ${VAI_HOME}/examples/Whole-App-Acceleration/apps/resnet50_waa_aie
    mkdir model_files
    cd model_files
    wget https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=resnet50-vck190-r2.0.0.tar.gz -O resnet50-vck190-r2.0.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf resnet50-vck190-r2.0.0.tar.gz
    ```
  Please note that the extracted folder and the model name may vary. Use appropriate name or path to the model file while running the application.
    
  * Create `resnet50_waa_aie` in the BOOT partition `/run/media/mmcblk0p1/` of the SD Card. Then copy the following contents to the `resnet50_waa_aie` directory.
    ```
        app_test.sh
        bin
        img
        model_files
        words.txt
        vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0
    ```

  * Please insert SD_CARD into the VCK190 board. After the linux boot, run the following to install Vitis AI runtime libraries and to perform various tests.
  * Installing Vitis AI Runtime on the Evaluation Board
    ```sh
    cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1/
    cp -r vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0/2022.1/aarch64/centos ~/
    cd ~/centos
