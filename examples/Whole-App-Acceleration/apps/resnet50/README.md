# Introduction
Currently, applications accelerating pre-processing for classification networks (Resnet-50) is provided and can only run on ZCU102/ZCU104 and VCK190 edge platforms , and U50/U280/U200 Alveo platforms. In this application, software JPEG decoder is used for loading input image. JPEG decoder transfer input image data to pre-processing kernel and the pre-processed data is directly stored at the ML accelerator input physical address. Below image shows the inference pipeline.

:pushpin: **Note:** In this application pre-processed data is directly stored at ML accelerator physical address. Hence, avoiding device to host data transfers.

# Run Resnet50 example
Resnet50 example can be run on different platforms like ZCU102/ZCU104 and VCK190 edge platforms or U50/U200/U280/VCK5000 data center platforms. Each platform has pre-built xclbin which can be used to set the system and run the application out of the box. And depending on the platform there are two more approaches, pre-built flow and build flow. Currently, only ZCU102 supports pre-built flow. In the subsequent sections, we give details for setting the system on a given platform and running resnet50 example.

## Setting up the system and running Resnet50 example on **ZCU102/ZCU104/VCK190**
The system to run Resnet50 example on ZCU102/ZCU104/VCK190 can be set using pre-built xclbin and build flow approaches. In addition, ZCU102 also supports pre-built flow approach. Setting up the system and running Resnet50 example include the following steps.

Initially, the the sd card is set following any one of the above approaches. Then, cross-compilation environment is installed on the host system followed by cross-compiling the resnet50 application. Later, Vitis AI runtime libraries, model files and image databse are downloaded. Finally, resnet50 example is run on the platform. 

These steps are summarizied as follows:
1. [Setting SD card](#1-setting-sd-card)
1. [Cross-compile Resnet50 example](#2-cross-compile-resnet50-example)
1. [Download setup files](#3-download-setup-files)
1. [Copying Resnet50 app and setup files](#4-copying-resnet50-app-and-setup-files)
1. [Run Resnet50 example on ZCU102/ZCU104/VCK190](#5-run-resnet50-example-on-zcu102zcu104vck190)

### **1. Setting SD card**
The SD card is set/flashed with `sd_card.img` file using Etcher like tools. Following approaches are used to create the image file.

#### **1. Using pre-built xclbin**
In this approach, the xclbin including pre-processing accelerator and DPU is already built and packaged to create a sd_card.img file.

* Download the SD card system image files from the following links:

  | No. | DPU                     | Device          | Download Link                                                                          |

  | 2   | DPUCZDX8G  | ZCU104          | [waa_zcu104_resnet50_v2_5_0.img.gz](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=waa_zcu104_resnet50_v2_5_0.img.gz)        |
  | 3   | DPUCVDX8G  | VCK190          | [waa_vck190_resnet50_v2_5_0.img.gz](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=waa_vck190_resnet50_v2_5_0.img.gz)        |
     
* Unzip the file and flash the `sd_card.img` file on the SD card using tools like Etcher.

#### **2. Using build flow**  
In this approach, the pre-processing accelerator and DPU are built from sources following the build flow.

| No. | Build flow                    | Device          | Documentation                                                                          |
|-----|-------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### **3. Using pre-built flow** 
The DPU is pre-built and its partial bitfiles are pre-created (using DFx flow). Only the pre-processing accelerator is built from sources. This flow gives 10x saving in build time for embedded platform like ZCU102.

| No. | Pre-built flow                    | Device          | Documentation                                                                          |

:pushpin: **Note:** Pre-built flow is supported only on ZCU102.

### **2. Cross-compile Resnet50 example** 
Once the SD card is set with sd_card.img system, cross-compilation environment is installed on the host system and the resnet50 application is cross-compiled.

  * Download the [sdk-2022.1.0.0.sh](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=sdk-2022.1.0.0.sh).

  * Install the cross-compilation system environment, follow the prompts to install. 

    **Please install it on your local host linux system, not in the docker system.**
    ```sh
    ./sdk-2022.1.0.0.sh
    ```
    Note that the `~/petalinux_sdk` path is recommended for the installation. Regardless of the path you choose for the installation, make sure the path has read-write permissions. 
    Here we install it under `~/petalinux_sdk`.

  * When the installation is complete, follow the prompts and execute the following command.
    ```sh
    source ~/petalinux_sdk/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
    ```
    Note that if you close the current terminal, you need to re-execute the above instructions in the new terminal interface.

  * Download the [vitis_ai_2022.1-r2.5.0.tar.gz](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=vitis_ai_2022.1-r2.5.0.tar.gz) and install it to the petalinux system.
    ```sh
    tar -xzvf vitis_ai_2022.1-r2.5.0.tar.gz -C ~/petalinux_sdk/sysroots/cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
    ```

  * Cross compile `resnet50` example.
    ```sh
    cd  ${VAI_HOME}/examples/Whole-App-Acceleration/apps/resnet50
    bash -x app_build.sh
    ```
      If the compilation process does not report any error and the executable file `./bin/resnet50.exe` is generated , then the host environment is installed correctly.

### **3. Download setup files** 

* Download Vitis AI Runtime libraries

  * Download the [Vitis AI Runtime 2.5.0](https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0.tar.gz). 

  * Untar the runtime packet. 

* Download model files for Resnet50

### **4. Copying Resnet50 app and setup files** 
* Create `resnet50` in the BOOT partition `/run/media/mmcblk0p1/` of the SD Card which is flashed using any one of the approaches of [Setting SD card](#1-setting-sd-card) section. Then copy the following contents of ${VAI_HOME}/examples/Whole-App-Acceleration/apps/resnet50 to the `resnet50` directory of the BOOT partition of the SD card.
    ```sh
    vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0
    model_files
    app_test.sh
    bin   
    img
    words.txt
    ```
* Insert the SD card into the destination ZCU102/ZCU104/VCK190 board and plugin the power. Connect serial port of the board to the host system. Wait for the Linux boot to complete.

* Install the Vitis AI Runtime on the board. Execute the following command.
    ```sh
    cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1/
    cp -r vitis-ai-runtime-2.5.0/2022.1/aarch64/centos ~/
