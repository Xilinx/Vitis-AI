# Example Guidance
Examples are meant to showcase features of Vitis AI, from simple inference to complex applications. These can also be thought of as tutorials, and include complete documentation and required source for users to modify them for their own purposes. These items should primarily be intended as vehicles to teach our users how to use Vitis AI to build their applications.
