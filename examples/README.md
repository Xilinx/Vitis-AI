# Demo Guidance
Demos are "as is" that are meant to showcase features of Vitis AI that are likely more complex than simple model inference. These items donâ€™t need to include significant documentation other than instructions to execute the demo, or source to reproduce or modify it.

# Example Guidance
Examples are meant to showcase features of Vitis AI, from simple inference to complex applications. These can also be thought of as tutorials, and include complete documentation and required source for users to modify them for their own purposes. These items should primarily be intended as vehicles to teach our users how to use Vitis AI to build their applications.
