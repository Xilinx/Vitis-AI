This directory containes instructions and examples for running DPU-v2 on Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC platforms. It can also be applied to Zynq-7000 platforms.
**DPU-v2**  is is a configurable computation engine dedicated for convolutional neural networks. 
It includes a set of highly optimized instructions, and supports most convolutional neural networks, such as VGG, ResNet, GoogleNet, YOLO, SSD, MobileNet, FPN, and others.
With Vitis-AI, Xilinx has integrated all the edge and cloud solutions under an unified API and toolset.
